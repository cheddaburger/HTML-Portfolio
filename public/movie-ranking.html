<h2> My Top 3 Movies of all time.</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>From Up On Poppy Hill</h3>
<p>The illustrations are beautiful and the story is incredibly touching. I love a good romatic movie. </p>

<h3>The Other Guys</h3>
<p>An amazing buddy cop movie that breaks down corruption in a simple way, while also being hilarious.</p>

<h3>The Batman</h3>
<p>An instant hit, something that I didnt know I was going love so much. 
It was one of the most thrilling movies I have ever seen.</p>
